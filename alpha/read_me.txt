::::::::::::::  ixi software  ::::::::::::::::Noiser 1.0http://www.ixi-software.netFor Windows (98, 2000 and XP) and Mac OS (9.2 and earlier versions).Well, this is a simple application. Place your soundfiles in the"snds" folder and click on the Noiser 1.0 logo. The applicationopens and you'll hear the Noiser make music out of your soundfilesaccording to some stupid algorithms. You can put .aiff, .wav and .mp3s into the "snds" folder.You can either play or record the Noiser 1.0 performance. If you are on Mac OS 9 or less, you'd have to cable the sound outinto the sound in to record the performance. Which, arguably, isa problem if you haven't got a mixer. (You won't hear what theNoiser is recording until the performance is over. But then again:this could be an advantage. And surprise is awaiting !)On a PC with Sound Blaster soundcard (and better) you can justclick the option "record what you hear" and the Noiser 1.0 willrecord the performance directly.When you stop the Noiser 1.0 performance, there wil be a soundfilein you noiser folder called : NoiseMachineOutputNote : The Noiser 1.0 has a free will, so it might take a while before he starts to play anything, or there might be some silencesin the middle of his performance.Enjoy !!!and peaceixi.
