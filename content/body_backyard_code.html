      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">Mirra Graphics Engine</font></strong><br>
        A Python OpenGL based 2D graphics framework. <br>
        Mirra is a 2D openGL python framework. It defines a set of classes to 
        render primitive shapes (Text, Pixel, Line, Circle, Rect, Bitmap, BitmaPolygon). 
        Mirra focuses on interaction and implements an event listener and classes 
        that receive mouse events. (in a way like macromedia director or flash 
        do).<br>
        It runs using pygame(SDL) but it can also be used under wxPython.<br>
        Mirra is also thought to teach students (basically design and multimedia 
        students) programming in python by playing around with graphics. Mirra 
        includes the SimpleOSC library.<br>

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">SimpleOSC : v0.2</font></strong><br>
        Simple API for the Open Sound Control implementation for Python (by Daniel 
        Holth, Clinton McChesney --&gt; http://wiretap.stetson.edu ).<br>
        The main aim of simpleOSC is to provide with a simple way to use OSC implementation 
        to make life easier to those who don't have understanding of programming 
        sockets. Thanks to Daniel Hotz and to Buchsenhausen, Innsbruck, Austria.

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">MIDIKeyboard</font></strong><br>
        The MIDIKeyboard is a SuperCollider GUI widget, pretty similar to the Keyboard 
        (kslider) object in Max - basically a tool to play MIDI notes and perhaps map scales, 
        visualise real keyboard, etc. The MIDIKeyboard does not handle any system-midi 
        (SC has other ways of doing that), the only "midi" about it is that the keys are 
        numbered according to the MIDI standard.

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">joeGendy</font></strong><br>
        joeGendy is a little example of how to communicate between SuperCollider and Max/MSP 
        using OSC (Open Sound Control). It is an example where information is sent from Max 
        to SuperCollider, but it is easy to change it for it to go the other direction.

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">XixiHID</font></strong><br>
        The XixiHID is a SuperCollider class that interfaces the HIDDeviceService of the language.
        This means that you can use this class to interface joysticks, gamepads, STEIM junXion boxes,
        and other controllers/sensors which support the HID standard. (Human Interface Device).
        Plug in your joystick and make some SuperCollider music!

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">ScrollNumberBox</font></strong><br>
        The ScrollNumberBox is a SuperCollider class that makes it possible to scroll values in a
        number box on a GUI. It doesn't work with FlowLayout at the moment but it works perfectly 
        otherwise.

       	In our workshops we go into how to communicate between networked computers and
       	between different programming environments. The communication takes place using the
       	Open Sound Control (OSC). Here you have some example patches in SuperCollider, Pure Data (PD),
       	Max/MSP and a Processing program that sends and receives OSC from the sound programming
       	environments.
