      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">SCIMP</font></strong><br>
        SCIMP is a SuperCollider Server client for 
        <a href="http://impromptu.moso.com.au/" target="_blank">Impromptu</a>. 
        The idea is to
        enable control of the fantastic SC audio server from the interesting 
        and expressive programming environment Impromptu.<br>

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">ParaSpace</font></strong><br>
        The ParaSpace is a 2D GUI where one can create or delete in real-time 
        parameter nodes in the space. The nodes can be created, selected, moved 
        around, connected and deleted. One can select many nodes at a time. There 
        is as little functionality as possible put into the ParaSpace, the idea 
        is to leave the real functionality to the user. The helpfile contains 
        some of examples demonstrating what is possible. <strong>[New: Cross-platform]</strong><br>

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">Grid</font></strong><br>
        This GUI widget can be useful in various situations such as representing 
        scales, step sequencers, etc. In some cases it might be better to use 
        the class BoxGrid. The Grid is basically a graphical representation of 
        2 dimensional array of columns and rows. <strong>[New: Cross-platform]</strong><br>

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">BoxGrid</font></strong><br>
        The BoxGrid is almost identical to Grid (the same code will work on both 
        classes). However, the graphical representation is very different and 
        it gives different connotations. It's good for creating sequencers, scale 
        representations, microtonality, polyrhythms, and other things which might 
        be good to represent in this 2D space. <strong>[New: Cross-platform]</strong><br>

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">MIDIKeyboard</font></strong><br>
        The MIDIKeyboard is a SuperCollider GUI widget, pretty similar to the 
        Keyboard (kslider) object in Max - basically a tool to play MIDI notes 
        and perhaps map scales, visualise real keyboard, etc. The MIDIKeyboard 
        does not handle any system-midi (SC has other ways of doing that), the 
        only "midi" about it is that the keys are numbered according to the MIDI 
        standard. <strong>[New: Cross-platform]</strong><br>

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">joeGendy</font></strong><br>
        joeGendy is a little example of how to communicate between SuperCollider and Max/MSP 
        using OSC (Open Sound Control). It is an example where information is sent from Max 
        to SuperCollider, but it is easy to change it for it to go the other direction.

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">XixiHID</font></strong><br>
        The XixiHID is a SuperCollider class that interfaces the HIDDeviceService of the language.
        This means that you can use this class to interface joysticks, gamepads, STEIM junXion boxes,
        and other controllers/sensors which support the HID standard. (Human Interface Device).
        Plug in your joystick and make some SuperCollider music!

      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#006699">ScrollNumberBox</font></strong><br>
        The ScrollNumberBox is a SuperCollider class that makes it possible to 
        scroll values in a number box on a GUI. It doesn't work with FlowLayout 
        at the moment but it works perfectly otherwise. [News: This class is depricated. 
        Blackrain made a class called SNBox to be found as a Quark]<br>
