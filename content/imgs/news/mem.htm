<p>About MEM</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Musica Ex Machina, MEM, is a new international festival of music, art, dance, 
  cinema and other vanguardist expresions. </p>
<p>MEM is an original idea and is organized by RMO Cultural Society (association 
  founded in 1988) and count with collaboration of artist collective Abisal and 
  communicate consulting APORAMA. </p>
<p>MEM will hapen in several places in Bilbao like BilboRock concerts hall, Espacio 
  Abisal gallery, and CMD San Francisco hall. </p>
<p>MEM will begin in november the 28th and will finish in december the 28th (see 
  attached programme). </p>
<p>In this first edition Musica Ex Machina defend pluridisciplinarity through 
  transgressor proyects in a moment when creation take no risks. MEM combine internacional 
  and local artists trying to find a fruitful dialogue between the different artists 
  presents in the festival; bring to Bilbao proposals that you can watch and enjoy 
  in other places around the world and at the same time and the best situstion, 
  to show some of the more interesting local projects. The way how MEM presents 
  and works is an important part of his bet and identity. </p>
<p>Musica Ex Machina born with the firme objetive of complete the cultural offer 
  of Bilbao and dinamize the city in an area inmerse in a full economic and cultural 
  expansion and regeneration. </p>
<p>MEM is a festival organized from and for Bilbao, is for that his identity is 
  completely joined to city&#146;s spirit. A Bilbao situated between the remembering 
  of an industrial past lost and a new age of information and new technologies. 
</p>
<p>MEM works from a cyberpunk imaginary, that crossing between the hygienic high 
  technology and the landscape surround us daily, industrial ruins, contamination 
  and noise. &#133;our closer landscape. </p>
<p>The places where MEM organize all the events are also involucrated in this 
  dynamic: BilboRock, CMD San Francisco, Espacio Abisal&#133; </p>
<p>Even though Bilbao at the present presents through the Guggenheim Museum and 
  the Technogical Area of Zamudio, MEM has chosen places sited in the core of 
  the city near the estuary, in an area that conserve the memories of the city. 
  A new bet with new elements in an old city scene. </p>
<p>Musica Ex Machina cross these ideas mentioned before about Bilbao and high 
  technology, with punk legacy, the &quot;do it yourself&quot;, and an contracultural 
  vision with elements of reflection and criticism. In relation with the concept 
  of the productions MEM presents, is important to coment that proliferation and 
  access to new production methods has cheapened technologies to install at home 
  all necessary equipment to produce music, video, and on-line and off-line publishing. 
  This accesibleness joined with a globalizated world, supposedly interconnected, 
  conduct us to reflect on the same cultural environment, the communication way 
  and the relation with the audience. </p>
<p>Evidently, entertainment, leisure, music as an encounter space, are also keys 
  of Musica Ex Machina. We hope all spectators enjoy it and astonish, that it 
  was a success of audience and artistic to get synergistic results that facilitate 
  the organization of other new editions. </p>
<p>MEM counts with conferences, round tables, exhibitions, performances, video 
  and cinema projections, net-art, video-jockeys and DJ&#146;s and concerts. </p>
