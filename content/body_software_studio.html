      <p>The current ixi applications are essential pattern generators. The software 
        uses .wav, .aif or quicktime format audio files.<br>
        <br>
        Please check the minimal requirements on the software download pages.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"> <b>So how does an ixi application fit in with my studio 
        set up?<br>
        </b>The current ixi programmes are standalone applications, they do not 
        require any hosts or specific audio setup to operate. As long as your 
        computer can process wav, aif or quicktime you can use the ixi applications.</p>
      <p align="left">Rather than telling you how to use the applications - there 
        are endless ways of using them - we would like to point out what they 
        generate as this should answer the common questions.<br>
        <br>
        The ixi applications process audio files, which are triggered by user 
        interactions with the interface of the software. The sound generated is 
        sent to the sound card and outputted to what ever speaker set you have.</p>
      <p align="left">To record the audio generated by the software you can do 
        one of the following:</p>
      <p align="left"><b>RECORDING<br>
        </b>Output to external recording device<br>
        Plug in a minidisk or dat recorder from you sound card and hit record!</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Soundblaster setup.</b><br>
        Creative Soundblaster has an unique tool that allows the user to record 
        &quot;what you hear&quot;. This will pick up the audio of the ixi applictions 
        before they reach the soundcard.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Audio out to audio in</b>.<br>
        Get a cable to patch the audio out of your computer to the audio in on 
        the same computer. This inbound audio can then be captured on an audio 
        editor such as soundforge, wave lab or goldwave. (see links page)</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Virtual Audio Cable</b><br>
        we havent used it - but Virtual Audio Cable from http://www.ntonyx.com 
        would enable you to play out from an ixi application and record into an 
        audio editor such as soundforge, wave lab or goldwave. (see links page).</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <b>MULTI RECORDING<br>
        </b>You can run more than one ixi application at the same time and record 
        the mix live. This will work only on PC's at present.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <b>USING THE RECORDINGS<br>
        </b>Once you've recorded the output of an ixi application, depending on 
        how you did the recording (see above), you can convert it to wav, aif 
        or whatever and drop it into your favorite sequencer or sampler. It's 
        worth checking our links page for software you can use to manipulate the 
        recording from your ixi software.</p>
      <p align="left">Once you're happy with the track - the next thing to do 
        is to get in contact with ixi label - we would really like to hear what 
        the results are.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MIDI</b><br>
        The current applications do not use midi - but they will....<br>
        <br>
        <b>FURTHER HELP</b><br>
        We try to help as many people as possible - but as we are only a small 
        team - we cannot answer every question we get asked - there's just not 
        enough time in the day. The best thing to do is signing up to the mail 
        list as there's normally a series of threads about how people use the 
        software. </p>
