      	Over the years, we have been giving workshops where we explore the creation 
	  	of musical instruments on the computer and their relationships to acoustic 
	  	instruments. We explore how graphical visualisation can help to control musical 
	  	patterns, but also physical controllers and sensors.<br>

		<p>We give three different types of workshops:</p>

		
      <p><font color="006699"><strong>Creative Software </strong></font></p>
      <p>In this workshop we are interested in creating our own creative software. 
        Instead of working within the limits of commercial software, we encourage 
        participants to create their own environments for their own personal expression. 
      <p>With this in mind, we go through open source sound programming environments 
        such as Pure Data and Supercollider and visual environments such as Python, 
        Processing/Java, Flash and Director. To communicate between the different 
        platforms we use the new and fantastic Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol. 

        These programming languages make everything possible and it the question 
        becomes: what do we do with them? 
      <p>We present the participants with other works in this field, theoretical 
        texts and have discussions about the aesthetics and theory of generative 
        audio, visuals and creative software. The participants create a project 
        of their own choice individually or in groups, trying to use some of the 
        technologies discussed. 

      <p><font color="006699"><strong>Extended Instruments</strong></font></p>
      <p>Here we deal with the question how new digital technologies can help 
        and inspire us when working with music. We are investigating how open 
        source software (such as Pure Data and Supercollider) can extend our acoustic 
        instruments and become part of their being. The computer can perform much 
        more functions than just being an audio effect. It can learn about the 
        musician, respond and improvise with the musician, and inspire him or 
        her to take new turns into unknown territories through new musical environments. 
      </p>
      <p>This workshop is for less technically oriented people but more aimed 
        at musicians interested in the relationship between technology and expression 
        and how technology can be utilised in musical improvisation. The idea 
        is that each participant brings along an instrument of choice (more than 
        one is welcome) and explores how that instrument can take on new musical 
        meanings in new this new context. Improvisation is a strong part of this 
        workshop. </p>
        
      <p><font color="006699"><strong>ixiQuarks, SuperCollider and synthesis</strong></font></p>
      <p>In this workshop we introduce the ixiQuarks: an improvisation environment built as an extension of SuperCollider. As such, it contains all the expressive power of SuperCollider, but provides users with many helpful tools, such as wavescopes, equalizers, filters, effects, spectral effects and last but not least the instruments which makes it easy to improvise in live situation with other musicians. 
      </p>
      <p>We will go into the basics of SuperCollider and introduce digital audio and audio synthesis according to the knowledge level of the participants. We cover the themes of digital vs. analog audio, digital signal processing, audio synthesis, design of audio effects, free and open source tools, the philosophy behind ixiQuarks, technology and expression, phenomenology of musical instruments, the culture of music technology</p>
