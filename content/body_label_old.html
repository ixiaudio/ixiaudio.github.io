      <br> The ixi label has been quiet. We've only released one CD, the &quot;Same 
        Same But Different&quot; generative music project by Runar Magnusson and 
        Thor Magnusson. A snapshot of that project can be heard at the <a href="http://www.r4nd.org" target="_blank">rand%()</a> 
        radio.
      <p>Why the inactivity? Many reasons, one being that new technologies make 
        pressing CDs and distributing them not as important as before. We are 
        interested in grass-root music making where people already send mp3s and 
        oggs to each other, bypassing the world of commercial music. </p>
      <p>Another reason is that we're more interested in live music - alive music 
        - either as generative music or improvisation and it is quite paradoxical 
        to record and release such &quot;music of the moment&quot; experiences.</p>
      <p>
        The third reason is time. We're quite busy doing other things and the 
        label somehow is the one that drags behind. It might change soon.</p>
      <p>
        We've had lots of people sending emails with links of music online made 
        with ixi software. Thanks for that and please continue. We try to keep 
        records of this and will contact you when we're releasing something, either 
        on a CD or as a netlabel release. </p>
      <p>If you are interested in sending in demos of your work, 
        please contact <br>
