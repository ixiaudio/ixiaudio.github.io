      <p align="left">ixi software is a collaboration between developers and musicians 
        using the software and giving reports on how they use it, some features 
        they would be interested in and bug reports. Without the feedback from 
        the users, it would have been hard to continue this work.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Requests</b><br>
        If there are any features that you are interested in seeing in a music 
        software or if you have an idea for some application, please contact us.</p>
      <p align="left">We regularily work with other artists making installations, 
        creative software, generative art or other things and we are open for 
        collaborations if the time and idea is right for us. <br>
