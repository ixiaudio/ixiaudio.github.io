      <p align="left">The ixi backyard is a space where we throw some stuff that are
      not typical "ixi applications". I.e, software that directly explores the graphical
      interface as compositional or pattern generating catalyst. Here you can also find
      texts, tutorials, code snippets, workshop stuff and classes for SuperCollider, Python or
      PD.</p>
      
      <p align="left">Check the contents of the links here on the left and you can find
      quite a lot of stuff that we've developed and use in our workshops or our own work,
      typically things that relate to sensors, sensor interfaces, HI devices, OSC (Open
      Sound Control), Python, Java, Processing, SuperCollider, Pure Data, Max/MSP, etc.</p>
