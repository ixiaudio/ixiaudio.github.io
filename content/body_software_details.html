      the <b>ixi</b> software is <b>free</b> for you to download. 
      <p align="left">The ixi apps do not have to be installed, so just run them 
        from wherever you want on your harddrive. Every application has a Read 
        Me file and it is important to check it out.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/text_live.gif" width="188" height="10" alt="LIVE PERFORMACE USE" border="0"></p>
      <p> We have tried to build the ixi software to be loaded and played without 
        straining your machine. They are very easy to install (just copy them 
        anywhere in your computer)</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>So why would i want to use an ixi app live?</b><br>
        As laptop computers have become cheaper we've seen more and more laptop 
        performances. Though no different to a DJ playing out, the audience always 
        seem to be faced with a musician sitting behind a black book with a glowing 
        apple mac icon - wondering what the hell he/she is doing. With ixi software, 
        it is easy to record soundfiles directly and instantly start to work with 
        them in an intuitive interface. The directness of the software is very 
        clear and one can manipulate the samples in realtime.</p>
      <p>With the current ixi apps - the performance is lived out through the 
        interface components. If you rigg up a projector to the laptop, the audience 
        can see you move the interface components around the screen and understand 
        how you are in control of the medium. We're not saying that this is fascinating 
        viewing for a 5 hour set, but definitely more inviting that what we've 
        seen before!</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>How do I record my performances?<br>
        </b>We recommend that in a live performance situation that you run as 
        few applications as possible. So to record your performance we recommend 
        that you connnect a recording device (eg. DAT or mini disc) to the outbound 
        mixing desk or PA system.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/text_studio.gif" width="86" height="10" alt="STUDIO USE" border="0"><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"> <b>So how does an ixi application fit in with my studio 
        set up?<br>
        </b>The current ixi programmes are standalone applications, they do not 
        require any hosts or specific audio setup to operate. As long as your 
        computer can process wav, aif or quicktime you can use the ixi applications.<br>
        <br>
        The ixi applications process audio files, which are triggered by user 
        interactions with the interface of the software. The sound generated is 
        sent to the sound card and outputted to what ever speaker set you have.</p>
      <p align="left">To record the audio generated by the software you can do 
        one of the following:</p>
      <p align="left"><b>RECORDING<br>
        </b>Output to external recording device such as aminidisk or dat recorder 
        from you sound card.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Sound card setup.</b><br>
        Many PC sound cards have a nicetool that allows the user to record &quot;what 
        you hear&quot; or &quot;Sound Mix&quot;. This will pick up the audio of 
        the ixi applictions before they reach the soundcard. You can run more 
        than one ixi application at the same time and record the mix live.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Audio out to audio in</b>.<br>
        Get a cable to patch the audio out of your computer to the audio in on 
        the same computer. This inbound audio can then be captured on an audio 
        editor such as soundforge, wave lab or goldwave. (see links page)</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Virtual Audio Cable</b><br>
        We havent used it - but Virtual Audio Cable from http://www.ntonyx.com 
        would enable you to play out from an ixi application and record into an 
        audio editor such as soundforge, wave lab or goldwave. (see links page).</p>
      <p align="left">On Mac OS X, we recommend the SoundFlower by <a href="http://www.cycling74.com" target="_blank">Cycling74</a>, 
        the company which makes Max/MSP, and that is a free software.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <b>USING THE RECORDINGS<br>
        </b>Once you've recorded the output of an ixi application, depending on 
        how you did the recording (see above), you can convert it to wav, aif 
        or whatever and drop it into your favorite sequencer or sampler. It's 
        worth checking our links page for software you can use to manipulate the 
        recording from your ixi software.</p>
      <p align="left">Once you're happy with the track - the next thing to do 
        is to get in contact with ixi label - we would really like to hear what 
        the results are.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MIDI</b><br>
        There are a couple of MIDI applications (Connector and Aurora)<br>
        <br>

        a question.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
      <p align="left">[for Linux users]<br>
        Sorry, our programs are not currently running on Linux. :-( <br>
        We are working on it.</p>
      <p>[for WinZip users]<br>
        How to uncompress a folder and its subfolders:<br>
        1. Start WinZip and open the Zip you want to uncompress<br>
        2. Select Extract from the Actions menu<br>
        3. Be sure the <b>Use folder names</b> checkbox is checked<br>
        4. Type the destination folder, for example C:\VIRUSES<br>
        5. Press the Extract button</p>
      <p>[for Stuffit users]<br>
        Some Mac users have reported problems when uncompressing the files with 
        Stuffit. When running the programs you might get an error saying that 
        the file is corrupted and the systemn cannot find the aplication it was 
        created with.<br>
        Try uncompressing with another version of Stuffit. If the problem persists 
        send us a email.</p>
