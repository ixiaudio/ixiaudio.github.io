<p><strong>Windscreen for Microphones</strong></p>
<p>Few years ago we made a DIY windshield for a recording trip in Iceland. It's 
  a windy country and<br>
  and it can be very frustrating to get the occational blow in the mic during 
  a good recording session.<br>
  People expressed wish to see the stuff in order to make their own, so here you 
  go... <br>
  <br>
  This windshield was made out of material costing around 40 Euros.</p>
<p>Check the pictures (they speak for themselves) and go to the hardware store.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Here you see a Rode NT-4 microphone inside the windshield 
  frame. The frame is made<br>
  out of a folded hen net, some wires and a iron bar that is screwed into the 
  net. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Rubber bands are used to hold the microphone steady 
  within the frame.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: In a fabric store I found this sexy fake fur for 
  the dead cat. It's made of thin and open<br>
  material so, the soundwaves travel easily through it.</p>
<p>Good luck with making your own microphone windshield, and please send us some 
  pictures of yours.</p>
