      <p>The Teaser is a piece of musaic, - of interactive visual music. The user 
        plays, explores, controls and navigates through a world of sound. At the 
        same time the computer is tracking the user's behaviour and directs him 
        or accordingly.</p>
      <p> The Teaser has few levels, each with its own characteristics. Each level 
        has 8 different sections which the user has to go through before getting 
        into next level. After one cycle (the 8 sections) the computer tracks 
        the user's behaviour sending him or her to the appropriate next level. 
      </p>
      <p><img src="imgs/teaser2.gif" width="120" height="120" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10">The 
        flake following the mouse is controlling the repeating sound which changes 
        on each level. If it is high on the screen, the pitch of the sound is 
        high and if it is on the left of the screen, the sound pans to the left 
        speaker. By clicking on the flake, the user goes to the next section. 
      </p>
      <p><img src="imgs/teaser3.gif" width="120" height="120" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10">The 
        rhythm track is built on a system of randomness where the program chooses 
        a path through a branching tree, where each node has a certain drum loop. 
        In this version of the Teaser the drum loop is played either 4 or 8 times 
        before it goes to the next branch. This system can be explored further 
        in the sketches section.</p>
      <p>The Teaser is thus precomposed, improvised and randomly generated at 
        the same time. It plays with tension and release, consonance and dissonance, 
        rhythm and non-rhythms, structure, repetition and variation, intensity 
        and volume.</p>
