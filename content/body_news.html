The workshop is offered to students at KIB (Kunst- og designhøgskolen i Bergen), Architecture, Creative writing (Skrivekunstakademiet i Hordaland) and The Grieg Academy (Griegakademiet). The workshop will explore the way we write with particular focus on sound. Abstract poetry like sound-poetry or after-language poetry, textual musical notation, algorithmic notation, secondary musical notation, sound poetry, concrete poetry, and graphic notation are all forms of writing that we will engage with during the workshop. We will make musical instruments, considering how their design is a process of writing. The workshop will be highly interdisciplinary - with participants from institutions of divergent practices - and we will consider approaches in thinking about writing sound, about composing instruments, writing algorithms, speaking notes, drawing sound.

    <strong><font color="#006699">Basque Icelandic pidgin music released</font> </strong> <br>
    In 1615 a ship of Basque fishermen who sailed to the sea north of Iceland every summer to fish whales were shipwrecked on the coast of North-West Iceland. 
    That was just a beginning of a sinister story. This history is multifaceted and includes, for example, a pidgin language and the first dictionary of the Basque language, 
    which was a Basque-Icelandic dictionary. In 2005 Thor Magnusson (Reykjavik) and Enrike Hurtado (Bilbao) travelled along the coast of Iceland staying at Drangnes and Norðurfjörður 
    where the events happened. For three days they did field recordings in that area focusing in the sounds of nature, which are today still almost the same as in 1615.

Using those sound recordings they played a concert at Buchsenhausen, Innsbruck, in November 2005. Here is the recording of that concert, and the pictures from the area where the source 
recordings where made
