      ixi audio is an experimental project concerned with the creation of digital 
      musical instruments and environments for generative music. We are interested 
      in the computer as a workshop for building non-conventional tools for musicians, 
      i.e. not trying to imitate or copy the tools that we know from the world 
      of acoustic instruments or studio technology. We currently work with open 
      source software such as SuperCollider, ChucK and Pure Data, but our aim 
      is to distribute our applications packaged in a way that allows everybody 
      to use them. Simplicity and ease of use together with depth in interaction 
      and expressive scope is the aim of our experimental music software.<br>
		<p>We are interested in free and open music software in all senses. Free 
        as in "free beer", free as in "free speech" and free as in "free jazz". 
        The last "freedom" being the most important one. We acknowledge the constraints 
        that software puts on the musician, the limits that the tool sets for 
        the creative process and we therefore promote and try to disseminate technologies 
        that open up the limits of software (or define new boundaries). We think 
        it should be the artist that defines the scope of his or her instrument 
        (and therefore music), not a commercial software company. </p>

		<p>Our belief is that controlling musical structures graphically in screen-based 
		instruments such as the ixi software, can be helpful and inspiring for the musician. 
		We try to build "non-musical" interfaces, i.e. controllers that do not contain 
		musical concepts from any tradition or cultureis can be liberating and open 
		up for new directions. Visualising musical patterns is one of the main ideas here, 
		but in a way that is open and not predefining the music. Intelligent interfaces is 
		also one of our aims and we'd like to see instruments that understand and interact 
		with the musician.</p>
		
      <p>As part of our activities we have been giving <a href="body_about_workshops.html">workshops</a> 
        at universities and art institutions where we go into the problem of audio-visual 
        programming and musical software. We are interested in instruments and 
        tools, i.e. the environments we can create to use in our expressive work. 
        Our workshops extend from 1 to 5 days, where we go into audio programming 
        on the open source platforms Pure Data, SuperCollider and ChucK, visual 
        programming platforms such as Python, Processing/Java, Director and Flash, 
        and then OSC (Open Sound Control) for communicating between the audio 
        and graphical environments. We also introduce concepts of analog to digital 
        conversion by using hardware interfaces that take voltage signals from 
        sensors and map them to digital information that become music or graphics. 
        Questions regarding interactive music, generative music, algorithmic art 
        and installations are dealt with and explored. The workshops have different 
        emphasis depending on the situation, they can be highly technical, musical, 
        theoretical or art based all according to the wishes and interests of 
        the participants.</p>

		
      <p>We provide the applications on this website as they are - there might 
        be some bugs, some problems or inconsistencies - we try to code them properly, 
        but we're not a company with customer support, we're a group of people 
        that enjoy making music and artistic software and giving them for others 
        to use as well.</p>
		
		<p>So download the programs, test them out, use them, distribute them, crack 
		them and do whatever you want except sell them. </p>
