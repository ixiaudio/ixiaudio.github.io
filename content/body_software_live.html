      <p> Ah! live performances. so much can go wrong when playing live - the 
        last thing you need is the software crashing every 2 minutes. But there's 
        no way around this - anyone who says otherwise is lying!</p>
      <p>We have tried to build the ixi software to be loaded and played without 
        straining your machine (check the minimal specs on the download page). 
        This means that it will work smoothly in a live performance situations.</p>
        
      <p><br>
        <b>So why would i want to use an ixi app live?</b><br>
        As laptop computers have become cheaper we've seen more and more laptop 
        performances. Though no different to a DJ playing out, the audience always 
        seem to be faced with a musician sitting behind a black book with a glowing 
        apple mac icon - wondering what the hell he/she is doing.</p>
      <p>With the current ixi apps - the performance is lived out through the 
        interface components. If you rigg up a projector to the laptop, the audience 
        can see you move the interface components around the screen and understand 
        how you are in control of the medium. We're not saying that this is fascinating 
        viewing for a 5 hour set, but definitely more inviting that what we've 
        seen before!</p>
        
      <p><br>
        <b>How do I record my performances?<br>
        </b>We recommend that in a live performance situation that you run as 
        few applications as possible to reduce the chance of a system crash. So 
        to record your performance we recommend that you connnect a recording 
        device (eg. DAT or mini disc) to the outbound mixing desk or PA system.</p>
      <p></p>
        
      <p><b>Who is using ixi apps live and where can I see them?</b><br>
        -have a look in the <a href="body_news.html">news and events section</a> 
        or the archive section.<br>
        <br>
        <b>I plan to play out live with ixi apps - what else do i need?</b><br>
        To tell us and the rest of the world. Drop us a line and we'll get it 
        onto the news and events page - and if we can make it the ixi crew will 
        pop down and have a look for ourselves - (any excuse for a beer!)</p>
