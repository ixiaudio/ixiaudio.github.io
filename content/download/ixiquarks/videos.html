      <p>This video shows the ixiQuarks tools browser, opens up the AudioIn tool 
        and a spectral view and wave view. Then a bufferPool is loaded (into RAM) 
        and soundfiles viewed in a soundfile view. A live sound is then recorded 
        into the bufferPool and played back. We then see an EQview (showing 31 
        bands). The sounds from the bufferPools are then manipulated in the SoundScratcher 
        instrument which allows for warp (granular synthesis), buffer scratching, 
        and various other methods of granular synthesis. We see how two windows 
        can be used at the same time. </p></td>

<p><strong>The SoundScratcher:</strong></p>
      <p>Here we see two Soundscratcher instruments performing granular synthesis 
        on two different soundfiles. We are using a Wacom tablet for drawing here 
        and therefore the lines have different pressure. (or z-axis)</p></td>

<p><strong>The Predators:</strong></p>
      <p>This video shows how a sound is recorded to disk, and then played back 
        from disk (not RAM) and output into a higher audio channel than the speakers 
        (0 and 1) and then an instrument called Predators is using that audio 
        stream as source sound for playing. The predators eat from the preys and 
        when they take a bite a sound is emitted. The pitch is related to the 
        vertical position of the pray. The Predators is an A-life application 
        of medium complexity.</p></td>

<p><strong>The Gridder:</strong></p>
      <p>The Gridder is here shown in some of its functionality, such as playing 
        sounds from the bufferpool, setting up scales and playing them. The Gridder 
        focuses on microtonality and scales and one can choose from multiple scales, 
        but also different tuning resolutions in equal temperament. (From 5-TET 
        (5 tone equal temperament) to 48-TET (where there are 48 notes in an octave)). 
        We also see how agents can be set into motion in the Gridder and play 
        notes from the scales automatically.</p></td>

<p><strong>The BufferPlayer, PolyMachine and ScaleSynth:</strong></p>
      <p>This video shows the BufferPlayer instrument, a very simple player of 
        soundfiles loaded into memory. There is a global control over some of 
        the parameters in the BufferPlayer. Then we see how an instrument called 
        PolyMachine is loaded up and used for creating rhythms. This instrument 
        is designed for polyrhythms and there are variable steps in each channel. 
        We finally see the ScaleSynth instrument that is well suited for Wacom 
        tablet use. The notes played colour the boxes so we see where we have 
        been on the grid.</p></td>

<p><strong>The PoliMachine and live-coding:</strong></p>
      <p>Here we see how the Polymachine is used in a live-coding session, i.e. 
        the boxes of the machine contain synthesis code that can be created and 
        manipulated in realtime while the instrument is playing. The user can 
        therefore modify the instrument after it has been started. Arguably this 
        is not a very successful live-coding session here, as the bass drum is 
        100 Hz and probably too low for this video and the sounds are not that 
        good.</p></td>

<p><strong>The Effects:</strong></p>
      <p>This video shows how the effects in ixiQuarks can be loaded up and taken 
        into use very easily. We then load up a noise generator which is routed 
        through an equalizer and then a klank filter. We also load a soundfile 
        into the Player and play that through the klank filter.</p></td>

      <p><strong>The GrainBox and SoundScratcher:</strong></p>
      <p>This video shows the GrainBox, a granular synthesis application that 
        makes the complex parameters of granular synthesis easy to use and understand 
        in 2D space. We then load up the SoundScratcher instrument and do further 
        granular synthesis on that. We record the drawn trajectories onto it and 
        then load up another instrument that we play whilst the first one plays 
        automatically.</p></td>

<p><strong>The SoundScratcher - more:</strong></p>
      <p>This video shows how the SoundScratcher can be used for rhythmic purposes 
        by arranging and rearranging the boxes that trigger the grains on the 
        view.</p></td>
