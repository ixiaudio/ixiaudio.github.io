      <strong><font color="#006699">ixi label releases </font></strong>[December 23rd, 2010]<br>
        ixi is pleased to announce the releases of works by Icelandic artist Sigurdur Gudjonsson and Basque musician Oier i.a. 
        
        <p>Sigurdur's work, Recorder 2010 is part of a larger audiovisual piece, but presented in this special edition for the ixi label. The original work is a video installation recently exhibited at SouthbySouthWest gallery Reykjanesbae Iceland. (For further details visit <a href="/web/20110108231805/http://www.sigurdurgudjonsson.net/" target="_blank">www.sigurdurgudjonsson.net</a>)
        
        <p>Oier uses sound textures obtained from natural sources for the creation of his works and live performances. He has composed music for dance, theatre, radio, video, installations and poetry recitals. In "Untitled" he continues the minimalistic path taken in some of his previous works and creates a long composition with a simple structure yet rich timbre.

        <p>Dowload links for both releases can be found on the<a href="/web/20110108231805/http://www.ixi-audio.net/label" target="_blank"> ixi label</a> page.
