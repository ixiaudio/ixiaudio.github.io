		As part of our research we have made a survey on people's relationship with their
		instruments (both acoustic and digital). We would love to hear about your experience,
		about your musical practise and the tools you use. Please help us to get an understanding
		of these things and fill out the survey 
		<a href="http://www.ixi-software.net/survey" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <strong><font color="#006699">Music made with ixi </font></strong><br>

      		Recently quite a few people have been sending us links to music made 
		    using ixi software in different ways (to manipulate field recordings, 
		    improvisation studio use, etc...)<br>
      <br>


			We thought it would be nice to have on our website a collection of 
			links to this music. So if you have got some music on-line on your 
			server or some net label, that was made using ixi at some point in 
			the production process, we would love to receive the the link and 
			put it on our website.<br>
      <br>


			The intention is just to put a collection of links in no particular 
			order and in no way	"curated" or judged aesthetically. 
			That's for other people to do.<br>
      <br>


			Send it to our info@ixi mail and please include the following information:<br>

			Artist name, contact email (not to appear online), URL, date, short description (~20 words)<br>
      <br>


			Looking forward to hear some music...<strong><font color="#006699"></font></strong></p>
