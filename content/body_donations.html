      <p>ixi software is a non-profit project, aiming at experimentation with 
        the graphical user interfaces of musical applications. When we started 
        the project in 2001, we decided to release the applications for free (as 
        in beer). You can download and use our software and we hope it is useful 
        for you. However, making and mantaining ixi software takes time and work, 
        and we also need money to maintain the ixi website. This is why we decided 
        to set up this donation system with PayPal. If you think ixi has helped 
        you then you can help ixi by making a donation here.</p>
      <p>PayPal accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and payments 
        from proper PayPal accounts. </p>
