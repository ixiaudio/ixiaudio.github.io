In order tofully comprehend   how advantageous Open Sound Control really can be, let us discuss afew topics   before hand. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) hastraditionally been   the protocol designed for recording and playing back music ondigital synthesizers   and has been supported by many makes of personal computer soundcards. The protocol   was originally intended to control one keyboard from another, however it was   quickly adopted for the personal computer. Rather than representing musical   sound directly, it transmits information about how music isproduced. The command   set includes note-ons, note offs, key velocity, pitch bend and other methods   of controlling a synthesizer. Open Sound Control (OSC) is a new protocol for   communication among computers, sound synthesizers and othermultimedia devices   that is optimised for modern networking technology. </font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A protocol is astandard procedure   for regulating data transmission between computers. A network is a group or   system of electric components and connecting circuitry designed to function   in a specific manner. A computer network that spans a relatively small area   is called a local-area network(LAN). Most LANs are confined to asingle building   or group of buildings. However, one LAN can be connected to other LANs over   any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. A system of LANs connected   in this way is called a wide-area network (WAN). An example of aLAN is IEEE-1394   which is a very fast external bus standard that supports data transfer rates   of up to 400 Mbps (400 million bits per second). A single 1394 portcan be used   to connect up 63 external devices. In addition to its high speed, 1394 also   supports isochronous data (delivering data at a guaranteed rate). This makes   it ideal for devices that need to transfer high levels of data in real-time,   such as video and audio devices. Products supporting this standard go under   different names, depending on the individual companies. Apple,which originally   developed the technology, uses the trademarked name Firewire. Another example   of this networking technology is Ethernet. Ethernet was developedby Xerox Corporation   in cooperation with DEC and Intel in 1976. Ethernet uses a bus (orstar topology)   and supports data transfer rates of 10 Mbps. The Ethernetspecification served   as the basis for the IEEE 802.3 standard, which specifies thephysical and lower   software layers. Ethernet uses the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access /   Collision Detection) access method to handle simultaneous demands. It is one   of the most widely implemented LAN standards. USB, short for Universal Serial   Bus, is an external bus standard that supports data transfer ratesof 12 Mbps.   In 1996, a few computer manufacturers started including USB support in their   new machines. It wasn't until the release of the best-selling iMacin 1998 that   USB became widespread. It is expected to completely replace serialand parallel   ports. A single USB port can be used to connect up to 127 peripheral devices,   such as mice, modems, and keyboards.</font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Open Sound Controlwas developed   with the goals of better integration of computer, controllers andsound synthesizers   in mind. The demand for lower costs, increased reliability, greateruser convenience   and more reactive musical control were all factors important in itsdevelopment.   Designers began by examining various networking technologiessuitable for carrying   OSC data and discussed features of these technologies that impactedthe design   of their protocol. </font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> OSC is a transport-independent   protocol which means that it is a format for data that can be carried across   a variety of networking technologies. Such networking technologiesinclude high   speed busses such as medium speed serial LANS like USB, IEEE-1394 (firewire),   Ethernet and Fast Ethernet (as discussed above) and all of which are becoming   widely available as well as affordable. Although a specific transport layer   was not a foremost consideration in OSC¹s development, aspects ofthese modern   mediums were taken into consideration. For example, Open SoundControl is transmitted   on systems with a bandwidth in the 10+ megabit/sec range. In comparison, the   bandwidth of MIDI is only 31.25 kilobit/sec, approximately 300 times slower!   In OSC numeric data is encoded in 32-bit or 64-bit quantities andincludes symbolic   addressing and time-tag messages. In general, the OSC format ismuch more generous   with its bandwidth for such important features.</font></h1><h1/> </h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The unit of transmission of OSC   is a packet (or datagram) rather then as a constant stream of data travelling   along an established connection. Rather then assuming that the receiver holds   some state from the previous communication, OSC sends information in larger,   self contained chunks that include all pertinent information in oneplace. This   leads to a protocol that is as stateless as possible. Anyapplication that sends   OSC Packets is an OSC Client; any application that receives OSC Packets is an   OSC Server. This packet-based delivery model provides a mechanismfor synchronicity.   Synchronicity means that messages in the same packet (for example, messages   to start each of the notes in a chord) will all begin their effectsat the same   time as each other. OSM assumes that the specific network serviceswill specify   the length of each of the packets it receives. Any application that sends OSC   Packets is an OSC Client; any application that receives OSC Packets is an OSC   Server. OSM is specifically designed so that any number of clients can send   any OSC messages to any particular devices connected together in a network.   OSM also assumes that the transport layer provides a return address mechanism   that allows the receiving device to send a response back to the device that   sends it a message.</font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The basic unit of OpenSound Control   data is a message. This message contains a symbolic address and message name,   and any amount of binary data up to the end of the message which represents   the arguments to the message. The size of an OSC packet is always a multiple   of 4. The OSC packet can contain either a single message or what is called a   ³bundle². A bundle is made up of the special string (³#bundle²), a64 bit fixed   point time tag and any number of messages or bundles, each precededby a 4-byte   integer byte count. Bundles have the ability to contain otherbundles. Messages   which are sent in the same bundle are atomic. This means that their effects   should all be implemented at the same time by the receiver. Inmultimedia applications,   the same characteristic ensures that values are assigned to different media   which must begin simultaneously. </font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An OSC server must have access to   a representation of the correct current absolute time. OSC does not provide   any mechanism for clock synchronization but again assumes that thetwo interacting   systems will provide a mechanism for synchronisation. Time tagseliminate jitter   introduced during transport by resynchronizing messages in a bundleand setting   values for when they should take place. This is extremely usefulfor users who   are implementing time lines or in situations where precise rhythmis necessary.   Time tags are represented by 64 bit fixed point numbers. The first32 bits encode   the numbers of seconds since January 1, 1900, while the remaining32 bits specify   fractional bits of second to an amazing precision of 200picoseconds. </font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Open Sound Controlemploys an open-ended,   dynamic,URL-style symbolic naming scheme fro message addressing. It¹s model   is a hierarchical set of objects that include synthesis voices,output channels,   filters and a memory manager. Particular objects of a set are accessed using   the same naming scheme of an URL, for example, /voices/droneb/resonators/3/set-Q.   Using this type of addressing allows different programs to createits own address   hierarchy so that the same objects will not need the same addressesfrom program   to program. Such addressing limitations are experienced inprotocols like MIDI   because it must rely on fixed length bit field. An entirepattern-matching syntax   has been designed to precisely and efficiently match addresses objects, but   we will not delve into this programming language. For more information refer   to the following websites: http://www.cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OSCorhttp://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/ICMC97/papers-html/OpenSoundControl.html.In   preliminary experimentation, the result is that ³with moderntransport technologies   and careful programming, this addressing configuration incurs no significant   performance problems either in network bandwidth utilisation or inmessage processing   (Matthew Wright, Adrian Freed)².</font></h1><h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Open Sound Control has been very   successful in its preliminary trials of transmission over UDP (User Datagram   Protocol) and Ethernet to control real-time sound synthesis in MAXon Macintosh   computers. Users enjoy improved precision and find it much easierto work with   symbolic names of objects rather then complicated mapping of channel numbers,   program change numbers and controller numbers as in MIDI. Thenumerous advantages,   efficiency, low cost and reliability of this new protocol make it a potential   replacement for current technology. It will give users more reactive musical   control their convenience as well as expand the every growingindustry of music   technology and the internet. </font></h1></body></html>
