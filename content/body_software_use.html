      the <b>ixi</b> software is <b>free</b> for you to download. 
      <p align="left">Read about the applications first and then download them.<br>
        The download page has instrucions on how to unzip the files and set them 
        up on your system. It is very <b>easy</b>. The ixi apps do not have to 
        be installed, so just run them from wherever you want on your harddrive. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Every application has a Read Me file and it is important 
        to check it out.</p>
      <p align="left">Come back soon as we are always working on new applications.</p>
      <p align="left">We are also updating the stuff for the <b>ixi label</b>. 
        We are collaborating with musicians that are currently working on (or 
        have already sent us) tracks that will be on the ixi label in the future.</p>

      <p align="left"><b>Beta Testing</b><br>
        We love good beta testers. Talk to us. <a href="mailto:beta@ixi-software.net">beta@ixi-software.net</a><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Requests</b><br>
        We like to make audio applications. Ask and you may receive... We have 
        produced some applications specially created for artists such as a tool 
        to conduct collective improvisations with colors and drawings or some 
        protoptypes for audiovisual installations. <a href="mailto:request@ixi-software.net">request@ixi-software.net</a>

      <p align="left"><img src="images/text_live.gif" width="188" height="10" alt="LIVE PERFORMACE USE" border="0"></p>
      <p> We have tried to build the ixi software to be loaded and played without 
        straining your machine. They are very easy to install (just copy them 
        anywhere in your computer)</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>So why would i want to use an ixi app live?</b><br>
        As laptop computers have become cheaper we've seen more and more laptop 
        performances. Though no different to a DJ playing out, the audience always 
        seem to be faced with a musician sitting behind a black book with a glowing 
        apple mac icon - wondering what the hell he/she is doing.</p>
      <p>With the current ixi apps - the performance is lived out through the 
        interface components. If you rigg up a projector to the laptop, the audience 
        can see you move the interface components around the screen and understand 
        how you are in control of the medium. We're not saying that this is fascinating 
        viewing for a 5 hour set, but definitely more inviting that what we've 
        seen before!</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>How do I record my performances?<br>
        </b>We recommend that in a live performance situation that you run as 
        few applications as possible. So to record your performance we recommend 
        that you connnect a recording device (eg. DAT or mini disc) to the outbound 
        mixing desk or PA system.<br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p align="left"> <b>So how does an ixi application fit in with my studio 
        set up?<br>
        </b>The current ixi programmes are standalone applications, they do not 
        require any hosts or specific audio setup to operate. As long as your 
        computer can process wav, aif or quicktime you can use the ixi applications.<br>
        <br>
        The ixi applications process audio files, which are triggered by user 
        interactions with the interface of the software. The sound generated is 
        sent to the sound card and outputted to what ever speaker set you have.</p>
      <p align="left">To record the audio generated by the software you can do 
        one of the following:</p>
      <p align="left"><b>RECORDING<br>
        </b>Output to external recording device<br>
        Plug in a minidisk or dat recorder from you sound card and hit record!</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Sound card setup.</b><br>
        Many PC sound cards have a nicetool that allows the user to record &quot;what 
        you hear&quot; or &quot;Sound Mix&quot;. This will pick up the audio of 
        the ixi applictions before they reach the soundcard. You can run more 
        than one ixi application at the same time and record the mix live.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Audio out to audio in</b>.<br>
        Get a cable to patch the audio out of your computer to the audio in on 
        the same computer. This inbound audio can then be captured on an audio 
        editor such as soundforge, wave lab or goldwave. (see links page)</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Virtual Audio Cable</b><br>
        We havent used it - but Virtual Audio Cable from http://www.ntonyx.com 
        would enable you to play out from an ixi application and record into an 
        audio editor such as soundforge, wave lab or goldwave. (see links page).</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <b>USING THE RECORDINGS<br>
        </b>Once you've recorded the output of an ixi application, depending on 
        how you did the recording (see above), you can convert it to wav, aif 
        or whatever and drop it into your favorite sequencer or sampler. It's 
        worth checking our links page for software you can use to manipulate the 
        recording from your ixi software.</p>
      <p align="left">Once you're happy with the track - the next thing to do 
        is to get in contact with ixi label - we would really like to hear what 
        the results are.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MIDI</b><br>
        There are a couple of MIDI applications (Connector and Aurora)<br>
        <br>
        <b>FURTHER HELP</b><br>
        We try to help as many people as possible. Drop us an email if you have 
        a question.</p>
