      <p><strong><img src="imgs/pic2.gif" width="120" height="120" align="right" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="10">Description 
        </strong></p>
      <p>Picker is an OSC (Open Sound Control) interface which has video and images 
        as colour filters. The four pickers of the application pick up and send 
        thouse colour values as OSC information to the application that hosts 
        the sound engine. OSC is a new protocol which improves on the limitations 
        of MIDI. At present, Supercollider, Max/MSP, Pure Data and Reaktor are 
        good examples of sound software that support OSC.</p>
      <p><img src="imgs/pic1.gif" width="120" height="120" align="left" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="10">There 
        are two video channels, one for recorded video and another for streaming 
        video. They can be blended and mixed together. There are also four image 
        channels where bitmaps can be overlayed to create more complex visual 
        texture. The RGB values and X and Y values are picked up by the four pickers 
        which send those values out through OSC. Each picker has a bang value 
        as well. Thus each picker has six channels of different numerical information 
        which is received by the sound engine. The pickers can be moved around, 
        they can move automatically or you can record their path.</p>
      <p>Picker is therefore like an instrument that morphes constantly and changes 
        shape. It is useful as a numerical generator where the numbers are generated 
        with a highly intuitive and user friendly way. These numbers are then 
        transformed into music. : )</p>
      <p>In the compressed <b>picker.sit</b> file you'll find the Picker program, 
        a Supercollider patch, and a Max patch for demonstration purpose. There 
        are also two SC patches by<a href="http://www.fredrikolofsson.com/" target="_blank"> 
        Fredrik Olofsson</a> and <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/fabrice.mogini/">Fabrice 
        Mogini</a>. The idea of Picker is that you, the musician, will build your 
        own patch in Supercollider, Max, Pure Data, or Reaktor. We would love 
        to see your patches, and, if you allow, distribute them together with 
        the Picker application when ready. We are sorry to admit, but Picker is, 
        for now, a Mac-only program. We are waiting for further developments of 
        the OSC technology we are using on the PC platform.<br>
