      <p>During the development of the ixi project we had different ideas we could 
        have explored but we did not have time for it. In this section you will 
        find a series of sketches that explain different directions and areas 
        to explore.</p>

      <p><img src="imgs/worms.gif" width="120" height="120" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10">The 
        Worm: <br>
        <a href="movies/worms.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Launch (16k) shockwave 
        8.5 required</a> <br>
        The Worm came into being when developing the sound pitch and panning for 
        the Teaser. It calculates the pitch and the pan relating to the location 
        of the mouse.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="imgs/tree.gif" width="120" height="120" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10">The 
        Tree: <br>
        The Tree is a system where sounds can be placed on different nodes in 
        a 1 to 16 branching tree structure. Thus, there are 31 sounds that can 
        play subjected to varying degree of control and randomness. The system 
        is built up such that it can easily be modified for different uses.</p>

      <p><img src="imgs/pixilamp.gif" width="120" height="120" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right">Pixilamp: 
        <a href="movies/pixilamp.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Launch (62k) shockwave 
        8.5 required</a> <br>
        In Pixilamp squares with random colour appear on the screen. The scale 
        of the randomness can be controlled by the user, using sliders for the 
        red, green and blue colour values. The speed of the changes can be controlled 
        and the size of the squares. The sound is triggered by a sound engine 
        that is connected to the square size and the speed of the squares. Three 
        different soundtracks can be chosen: plain synth, varied synth and tabla 
        drums. </p>

      <p><img src="imgs/ducky.gif" width="120" height="120" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="1">Ducky: 
        <br>
        Ducky is formed by 4 objects playing the same sound with a different pitch. 
        The pitch depends on the position on the screen. The whole structure can 
        be dragged across the screen allowing different sets of pitches. Two sliders 
        allow the user to set different parameters that affect the relation between 
        the object (stickiness and elasticity). Custom sounds can be imported.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="imgs/grid.gif" width="120" height="120" align="right" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="10">The 
        Grid:<br>
        The Grid is made up of several sub-objects that can be dragged, affecting 
        the whole structure and therefore the sound related to each object. Two 
        sliders allow the user to set different parameters that change the relation 
        between the objects (stickiness and elasticity). Custom sounds can be 
        imported.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="imgs/layers.gif" width="120" height="120" border="1" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10">Layers: 
        <a href="movies/layers.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Launch (98k) shockwave 
        8.5 required</a> <br>
        In this instrument you can layer up to 8 sounds. You can change the pitch, 
        volume and sound applied to each one. You can also import your own sounds 
        into it.</p>

      <p><img src="imgs/micspace.gif" width="120" height="121" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10">MicSpace: 
        <a href="movies/micspace.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Launch (158k) 
        shockwave 8.5 required</a> <br>
        Micspace is an experiment with sounds in space and how to record a track 
        through arranging the sounds location and the spatial relation between 
        them. It is 2D at the moment, but should be seen as a possible extention 
        to the project micWorld, where 3D space is used to control sounds.</p>
