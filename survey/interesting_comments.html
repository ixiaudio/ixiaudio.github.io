<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This is directly related to how much practice I have done. In the (usually normal) case that I haven't practiced at all, the trumpet exhibits a high amount of instability. Sometimes this is enjoyable. It may even be a desirable musical quality. From past experiences however, I know that when I do practice, the trumpet is very deterministic unless it is playing improv Jazz, at which point fantastical suprises can be discovered. I was once playing Birdland (a great Jazz classic) in a band, and at the end of the gig, was supposed to play a Super-C. A Super-Super-C came out instead (ie a 4 octave range), which is actually pretty much impossible unless you're Miles Davis, and I'm not, so it was a highly unexpected and rewarding thing to happen. I never was able to repeat it, despite many attempts. The strange thing was that I didn't even try, I've no idea how it happened.</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Well they're too different to ask such a simple question, to be honest. Software lacks physical, intuitive interfaces, but then computers were not really designed for these features and shoe-horning them onto a computer can be a big mistake (that's why I dont use a MIDI controller, or any such thing). Computers enjoy numbers and text, sometimes icons and GUIs, so these are the preferred facilities I'd stick to (in that order).</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Argh! Yeah, I know where you're going with this and respect to you for exploring it, but it's not really my cup of tea. I've tried unsuccessfully many times to go down this route, but at the end of the day, the way I interact with software is using a keyboard, a mouse, maybe a trackpad. Not much else. I type a lot. Touchscreens are nice but they're rare. I'd rather type numbers into a grid than twiddle knob (virtual or not). Knobs are great for some things but rarely are they perfect for everything.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It can very often lack the intuitive physicality of "real" instruments. I've been working on a system that creates computer music using the full range of expression from a vocal mic input, which works well for me (as a beatboxer etc). Systems such as interactive tables or video inputs still seem unbelievably klunky to me, in comparison to acoustic instruments.</p>

Still there are an infinite variety of sounds to be made but this subset of infinity is much smaller than the infinite variety available by a computer. This is also a strength in a strange way since it focuses your attention on the sounds you can make. This makes you more creative much like a haiku forces creativity.

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I suppose I would be reluctant to criticise the guitar for lacking functionality when I could just as easily criticise my technique, and the guitar is by now a highly refined instrument which has evolved over a long period of time. Nevertheless, I can see much untapped potential for integrating the guitar into electronic music, beyond the MIDI pickup. In the case of the electric guitar, I also believe that the instrument is not just the guitar, rather it is the entire signal chain from guitar to amp, including effects pedals and whatnot. So with this in mind, if I ever felt that an electric guitar lacked functionality, in terms of sonic characteristics, there is always another amp or another effects pedal to try out.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>#1 difference: The decoupling of the gesture/the interface from the sound making part that happens with electronic instruments.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">That has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages are the freedom to map gesture to sound in any conceivable way. Disadvantages include the loss of 'feel' that can happen as a result of this decoupling unless this issue has been specifically addressed by the instrument <b>designer</b>.</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This is an interesting question. While I believe that limitations can foster creativity, there is no denying that some limitations can hamper expression or expressive potential. I suppose the instrument should allow some degree of expression in order to be useful. How much expression is a difficult question to answer. A cowbell is less expressive than a piano, but they each have their uses! Similarly, a single sine wave oscillator or a theremin is arguably less versatile than a Yamaha CS-1 but then in the hands of the right player a theremin can be amazing in its own right, so it is often down to how it is used, as in the skill of the performer and the context in which it appears. Electronic/digital instruments are so new and are evolving so rapidly that long-term dedicated practice on these digital instruments isn't ever heard about, and sometimes digital musicians are treated more like consumers and are expected to keep upgrading to the latest version of the product. Nobody ever picks up a violin and expects to be able to make a passable sound with it within a 10 minutes, so as long as there is an expectation for instant gratification from digital instruments then how can they ever expect to rival acoustic instruments in expressive potential?</p>

I am not against - but not completely for. this recombinate quality is attractive - but after the attraction is over - the question remains about the actual experience. and then i feel we return to the age old discussion of aesthetics that is independent of how the sound is made - but what is the resulting experience poetically/artistically or what have you - this is a subject that must be defined and i feel must always be returned to.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both. Musicians should never accept the limitations of their instrument without evaluting the results. In other words, people say Ornette Coleman has his own concept of intonation. I say he simply plays the saxophone without thinking about intonation at all, and hence his music conforms not to his particular concept of intonation by by the predetermined intonation tendencies of the saxophone. If I were to play the same way on tuba, I would be out of tune, but not just out of tune randomly, out of tune only where the instrument has inherent tendencies. For me to then claim that this just happens to be exactly how I intended to sound before I had ever played the tuba would be totally dishonest. (for the record, I am a fan of Ornette; he's just and easy target for this particular discussion)</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I swicthed to the harpsihord because it's lighter and more portable that the piano. That's because the entire harpsichord body is made of wood. It's easier to take it around when I perform. However, because there is no big metal structure in the harpsichord, it is very sensitive to environmental changes and to temperature flactuations. I have to tune my harpsihord at least once a month. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I am not quite sure what else you mean when you say 'fucntionality'. A musical instrument is functional when it produces sound - any sound. Even lack of portability is not really a problem now that we have computers and are able to prerecord and manipulate sound live on stage.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I have no full control of the instrument. That's one of the most exciting parts of playing on it. I always look for new challenges when I play an instrument. In a way, one of the reasons I started playint the harpsichord after two decades of playing the piano was that I was too familiar with the piano, I was so close to it I felt restricted. I always pick new instruments to discover what other sound I can produce with them - and at the beginning, when I have no idea how to play on them, they are in control not I.

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While experimenting on acoustic inrtuments I use computers to record, manipulate sound, edit and finilise my ideas. Computers opened up new posibilities for me, since my music is very symponic and multilayered, but I work primarily on my own. Initially I found the disconnection between dynamics and melody very difficult to deal with. It was as if feeling was somehow drained out from the music. Eventually I found ways to work with this and make computer-generated noises sound fragile and sensitive. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I find the whole computer language, the storage and filing system very difficult. It might be because I have mild dyslexia. I find that learning a software involves changing one's vocabulary to fit someone else's... who may not in fact be a musician, but a computer programmer. I sometimes spend hours trying to achieve something, simply because I use the words 'mirror' or 'invert' for what a computer programmer has decided to call 'flop'. I would be happier if I could change that - if I could personalise the different functions and call them what I wnat to call them, what I understand. Of course this would make the software manual useless... Also, I have 4 external hard-drives and hundreds of cds and dvds which contain back-ups of my compositions. It all just makes me think of music in digital memory currency...</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">My guitar is an organic extension of self. (Sorry if this is a bit mystical, but really, the relationship between a reasonably accomplished musican and their instrument really is quite mystical).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">When I'm playing guitar, the mechanics of sound production are totally transparent to the conscious process of playing music: I think of what I want to play, and the music appears. No part of conscious mind is actively monitoring the technical aspects of playing the instrument.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">As far as the electronics goes, the relationship is much less satisfcatory. I'm really impressed by what happens with the p5 glove compared to other musical controllers. It carries promise of providing the same kind of unconcious extension of body that my guitar does, in a way that knobs sliders and keys do not. But it's still a brutally inefficient and inaccurate controller. I have no doubt that virtuoso p5 glove performances are not a thing that's worth pursuing. Which is a shame. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2">Guitar: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Jazz improvisation is very much a stochastic process, even for accomplished players. You have to be prepared to roll with the unexpected. Mistakes do happen, but, for the most part, the behaviour of my guitar is very deterministic. Deterministic to the extent that ther are very subtle interactions going on when I play.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I've noticed this when making setup or equipment changes. Something as simple as changing the weight of strings will throw things off balance just enought that I do have to consciously work to control the mechanics of sound production. And it may take a week or two to get back to the same state of unconsciuos control. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Computer music:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Quite the opposite. So far, the challenge has been to lose control of computer instruments, in a way that's organically pleasing and satisfying. The problem with computer electronics seems to be that of too much control, in a sequenced kind of way, rather than not enough control. On the other hand, building meaningful control structures that allow midi controls to be used in a way that produces meaningful structure in the resulting music is hard too.</p>

<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Do you use Open Sound Control (OSC)? If so, what do you use it for?:</b></p>

<p class="p2">Digital instruments seem to be a bit more user friendly in that it doesn't take long using the proper digital instruments to create something that sounds good, or at least palatable.

<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Software CAN sound just as deep, and CAN be controllable in performance, but this always seems to involve a lot of re-invention, and one never becomes as practiced. I find most musicians don't in fact make deep sounds with software. But it is possible. I can do it!</p>

<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Computer software ALSO lacks standards. MIDI is a standard but is too imprecise. Music software needs a flexible, universal, extensible standard for representing music at a low level.

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">I think there are two ways to answer this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">My theory is that there are three domains for the criteria one uses to evaluate whether one has a rewarding relationship with one's instument: the person's musical goals, the way one prefers to interact with one's instrument, and the amount of money that one feels comfortable spending on the instrument.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Musical instruments are technological constructs or funinctions that encode thoughts and emotions in spatial messages, almost always using the medium of sound. I think there is a greater likelihood that musical instuments were the bridge from gestures to speech<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>human evolution than being an offshoot of speech.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>How much 'unstable' or 'non-deterministic' behaviour is there in your instrument? Do you feel that you always have full control over it? :</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Can you describe this feature?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">I like random functions. There is plenty of inherent variation in stringed instuments but substanitally less in electronics. I like giving away some control as long as I have options or can decide where this will happen. Chaos and unpredictability are an essential feature of music.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>What music software do you use and why? Have you tried or do you use any of the following audio programming environments? If so, how often do you use them?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">Sonic possibilities and flexiblity is the most important. I usually prefer code to UIs that use virtual patch cables which I find become more hassle than they are worth. They speed things up at the beginning, but slow things down later. Ability to encapsulate functions is important. Real-time is nice, but not necessary.</p>

<p class="p2">I write programs for specific purposes, basically one program per piece.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I realised some time ago that trying to write some general-purpose tool was going to be futile (after I wasted quite a bit of time...)</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">It seems to me that for many composers the limitations of acoustic instruments are often a source of creative inspiration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have written some pieces for acoustic instrument and tape; I was able to work with good players, and learnt to some extent to take an instrument on its own terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">For what I do now the limitations are perhaps more subtle; in one sense I can do anything, but I need an idea that makes sense to me and to (some) other people.</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">No/Yes; even though it does have a physically limited range of tonal expression, I appreciate it for it's genuine character and unique identity as a music instrument.</p>

<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>How much 'unstable' or 'non-deterministic' behaviour is there in your instrument? Do you feel that you always have full control over it? :</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Can you describe this feature?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">Unstable characteristics are few. It is an old instrument, and very stable. There is enough consistency in the instrument to fool my ear into thinking it is constant.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>How much do you know about the history of your instrument? Do you think it could have been built differently? Are you aware of the ergonomical (or other) issues in the way it is designed?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">The history of the violin is a long one, and there have been many innovations in the life-time of the instrument. I see violins built differently every time I encounter a new Luthier, and am convinced that there are few improvements to be made.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>What are the biggest differences for you in playing acoustic and digital instruments? (if applicable) :</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">Digital instruments tend to demand more careful listening and intense focus (at least mine do) than thier acoustic counterparts. I find that performing on my synth-violin presents a performance experience that is fundementaly more complex, significantly more powerful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The acoustic instrument presents a single voice, with many angles but still a clear identity. With the digital, there is the addition of learning a new character, of exploring new techniques. In one hand there is pursuit of master, in the other simple exploration.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Does computer software lack something that acoustic instruments have? If so, what?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">I would say yes, and it's all in the interface. At this point, I have yet to see the interface that can replace the tactile experience offered by a fine acoustic instrument. Most noticibly in the performance area.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Do acoustic instruments lack something that digital instruments have? If so, what?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">Certainly, breadth of possibility. My acoustic instrument has one voice, my digital can posses a theoritical infinite variety.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Do you have a need for musical software that doesn't exist? What would your dream musical software be like?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">My dream musical software would be as solid and responsive as Audiomulch, with a slightly improved GUI (to allow for better visualation of feedback chains), an internal system for routing controle signals apart from audio and midi, with a resonable kit of analoge primitive components such as buffers, filters, and envelope followers.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>What virtual or physical interfaces would you like to see in computer software?:</b></p>
<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">I would like to see a physical interface that isn't flat and rigid, or composed entirely of knobs and sliders, or isn't prohibitively expensive (like the I-CubeX or Lemur). I'd like to see a robust output language supported, something more than midi. It needs to allow for enough physical movement in peformance to keep an audience interested.</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">I see at this moment in history a convergence taking place between the two perspectives. This survey is certainly evidence. Isn't it self-defeating to find creative inspiration from an instrument? Who tells stories of pens, paints pictures of brushes, and writes music about oboes?</p>

<p class="p2">----------------------------------------</p>
<p class="p2">a little - eg bass guitar has slightly unstable features such as playing overtones, or employing fret rattle by holding fingers on fretboard not hard enough to clamp the string properly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>these are not entirely unstable processes, but are not entirely controllable either...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>further extended techniques provide for even more timbre variance from the standard modes of play.</p>

<p class="p2">they are all a source of creative inspiration in the sense that the possibility of digital instruments to potentially make any sound mainly leads to endless searching, not polished creation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>limitations mean that something can be done with what is possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this prevents wasting time endlessly searching for the unknown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(although it is fun to do this sometimes!)</p>

<p class="p2">The piano at my house at the moment is very broken, which is a form of 'unstable'. I like this instability when using instruments in general, as it means you are going to end up with more interesting noises than if you just sat down with a stable, deterministic device.</p>

<p class="p2">Yes, which is why I use PureData. Software that listens as well as plays would be great, something that can make a reasonable guess as to what the current key is and where the beat is, to use as a basis for performance. Also something that knows the mechanical bits of music, such as what chords sound good following what other chords, so that it could make decisions for me.</p>
